College-C-Programming
===================

College-C-Programming is a repository where I upload basic programming assignments from college related to the C++ programming language using Microsoft Visual Studio.

StudentWorks is a basic C++ console program which serves as a hub connected to every other C++ console program I had to write while in college. This program serves as a foundation for my knowledge of basic C++ principles and console programming and will occasionally receive updates to enhance its usability and presentability.
