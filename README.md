College-Programming
===================

College-Programming is a repository where I upload basic programming assignments from college. Currently it only features my work with the C++ language.

StudentWorks is the first program I committed to College-Programming and is a basic C++ program which serves as a hub connected to every other C++ program I had to write while in college. This program serves as a foundation for my knowledge of basic C++ principles and will ocasionally receive updates to enhance its usability.
